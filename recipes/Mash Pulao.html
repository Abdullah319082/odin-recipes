	<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>150g basmati rice/long grain rice</li>
		<li>75g mung beans</li>
		<li>1/3 teaspoon green cumin seeds </li>
		<li>1 onion, chopped</li>
		<li>1cm ginger, peeled and chopped</li>
		<li>1-2 green chillies (to taste), chopped</li>
		<li>½ bunch fresh coriander</li>
		<li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
		<li>¼ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
		<li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
		<li>75g dried apricots</li>
		<li>450ml water or veg stock</li>
		<li>Salt to taste</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Method</h2>
	<p>
1. Wash the rice and soak it for around 20 minutes. At the same time, put the apricots in a separate bowl of water to soak.<br>

2. Put the mung beans in a pan of water and bring it to the boil. Cook for around 20 minutes - until the beans are edible, but not mushy - and then drain, setting them to the side.<br>

3. Heat some oil in a saucepan and fry the cumin seeds for a minute or so. Follow them up with the onion, ginger and chillies.<br>

4. As the onion is softening, drain the apricots and finely chop them. Once the onion has softened, add the other spices and chopped apricot, stirring well.<br>

5. Add the rice, water/vegetable stock and a pinch of salt, cover the lid of the pan, turn the heat down and let it simmer for around 15 minutes until the rice is cooked. Add the mung beans for the last 3-5 minutes.<br> 

6. Take off the heat and stir in the coriander. Best served with natural yoghurt and salad.<br>
